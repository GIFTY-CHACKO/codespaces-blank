### Project Description
Waste Locator System is a web platform that connects citizens with nearby garbage collectors. Users can upload waste photos with location details so collectors can quickly find and clean the area.

### The Problem statement
Waste often remains uncollected because people don’t know who to contact, and collectors don’t receive timely or accurate location information. This communication gap delays cleanup and affects public hygiene.

### The Solution
The system allows users to upload waste images and location data. It automatically matches reports with registered collectors serving that area and displays them instantly for quick response.
